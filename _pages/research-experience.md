I was in the [Gemstone Honors Program at UMD](https://gemstone.umd.edu/){:target="_blank"}. As part of Team Affordable Natural Disaster Relief Robotics (ANDRR), I researched, prototyped, and tested an accessible modular system that can be attached to hobby quadcopters to enable onboard computer vision for the purposes of disaster relief. Our research started in the Fall of 2022 and concluded in the Spring of 2025. We wrote a thesis and successfully defended it in front of a panel of discussants. You can learn more about our research and read our thesis [here](https://teamandrr.wordpress.com/){:target="_blank"}.

Over the summer of 2025, I plan to work with [Dr. Yiannis Aloimonos](https://scholar.google.com/citations?hl=en&user=7QmEsOwAAAAJ&view_op=list_works){:target="_blank"} and [Levi Burner](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=BKY_uwoAAAAJ&hl=en){:target="_blank"} on computer vision research regarding optical flow.
