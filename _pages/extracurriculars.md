## Gamer Symphony Orchestra
I am part of the [Gamer Symphony Orchestra (GSO) at UMD](https://umd.gamersymphony.org/index.php){:target="_blank"}. We are a full symphonic rock orchestra that arranges and plays music from video games! I serve as the cello section leader and webmaster. Here is a [link to our YouTube channel](https://www.youtube.com/c/GamerSymphonyUMD){:target="_blank"}. Below is the recording of one of my favorite arrangements.
